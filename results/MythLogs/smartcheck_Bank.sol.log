==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Medium
Contract: Bank
Function name: withdraw()
PC address: 392
Estimated Gas Usage: 681 - 1152
A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
The callee address of an external message call can be set by the caller. Note that the callee can contain arbitrary code and may re-enter any function in this contract. Review the business logic carefully to prevent averse effects on the contract state.

Transaction Sequence:

Caller: [CREATOR], data: [CONTRACT CREATION], value: 0x0

==== State change after external call ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Medium
Contract: Bank
Function name: withdraw()
PC address: 474
Estimated Gas Usage: None - None
The contract account state is changed after an external call.
Consider that the called contract could re-enter the function before this state change takes place. This can lead to business logic vulnerabilities.

balances[msg.sender]=0

==== Integer Overflow ====
SWC ID: 101
Severity: High
Contract: Bank
Function name: recharge()
PC address: 546
Estimated Gas Usage: 5674 - 25959
The binary addition can overflow.
The operands of the addition operation are not sufficiently constrained. The addition could therefore result in an integer overflow. Prevent the overflow by checking inputs or ensure sure that the overflow is caught by an assertion.

Contract: Attacker
Function name: attack()
PC address: 849
Estimated Gas Usage: 8696 - 97683
