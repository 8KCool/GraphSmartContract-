==== Integer Overflow ====
SWC ID: 101
Severity: High
Contract: RequestSale
Function name: fallback
PC address: 232
Estimated Gas Usage: 6862 - 27477
The binary addition can overflow.
The operands of the addition operation are not sufficiently constrained. The addition could therefore result in an integer overflow. Prevent the overflow by checking inputs or ensure sure that the overflow is caught by an assertion.
