==== Exception State ====
SWC ID: 110
Severity: Low
Contract: Balancer
Function name: fallback
PC address: 3427
Estimated Gas Usage: 2577 - 3471
A reachable exception has been detected.
It is possible to trigger an exception (opcode 0xfe). Exceptions can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. Note that explicit `assert()` should only be used to check invariants. Use `require()` for regular input checking.

Potential denial-of-service if block gas limit is reached.
A message call is executed in a loop. Be aware that the transaction may fail to execute if the loop is unbounded and the necessary gas exceeds the block gas limit. This issue is reported for internal compiler generated code.

The contract executes an external message call.
An external function call to a fixed contract address is executed. Make sure that the callee contract has been reviewed carefully.

PC address: 4409
Estimated Gas Usage: 2184 - 40650
The return value of a message call is not checked.
External calls return a boolean value. If the callee contract halts with an exception, 'false' is returned and execution continues in the caller. It is usually recommended to wrap external calls into a require statement to prevent unexpected states.
