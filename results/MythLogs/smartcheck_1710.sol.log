==== State change after external call ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Low
Contract: MiddleSaleService
Function name: fallback
PC address: 1557
Estimated Gas Usage: None - None
The contract account state is changed after an external call.
Consider that the called contract could re-enter the function before this state change takes place. This can lead to business logic vulnerabilities.
