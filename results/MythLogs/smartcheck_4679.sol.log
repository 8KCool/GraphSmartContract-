==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Medium
Contract: TokedoDaico
Function name: constructor
PC address: 438
Estimated Gas Usage: 17935 - 82681
A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
The callee address of an external message call can be set by the caller. Note that the callee can contain arbitrary code and may re-enter any function in this contract. Review the business logic carefully to prevent averse effects on the contract state.

==== State change after external call ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Medium
Contract: TokedoDaico
Function name: constructor
PC address: 499
Estimated Gas Usage: None - None
The contract account state is changed after an external call.
Consider that the called contract could re-enter the function before this state change takes place. This can lead to business logic vulnerabilities.

==== Dependence on predictable environment variable ====
SWC ID: 116

Function name: ended()
PC address: 4008
Estimated Gas Usage: 1091 - 1467
A control flow decision is made based on a predictable variable.
The block.timestamp environment variable is used in to determine a control flow decision. Note that the values of variables like coinbase, gaslimit, block number and timestamp are predictable and can be manipulated by a malicious miner. Also keep in mind that attackers know hashes of earlier blocks. Don't use any of those environment variables for random number generation or to make critical control flow decisions.
