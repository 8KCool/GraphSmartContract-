==== Integer Overflow ====
SWC ID: 101
Severity: High
Contract: ERC20nator
Function name: fallback
PC address: 230
Estimated Gas Usage: 13987 - 123304
The binary multiplication can overflow.
The operands of the multiplication operation are not sufficiently constrained. The multiplication could therefore result in an integer overflow. Prevent the overflow by checking inputs or ensure sure that the overflow is caught by an assertion.

The contract executes an external message call.
An external function call to a fixed contract address is executed. Make sure that the callee contract has been reviewed carefully.

Multiple calls are executed in the same transaction.
This call is executed after a previous call in the same transaction. Try to isolate each call, transfer or send into its own transaction.

==== State change after external call ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Low

Function name: fallback
PC address: 550
Estimated Gas Usage: None - None
The contract account state is changed after an external call.
Consider that the called contract could re-enter the function before this state change takes place. This can lead to business logic vulnerabilities.

A reachable exception has been detected.
It is possible to trigger an exception (opcode 0xfe). Exceptions can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. Note that explicit `assert()` should only be used to check invariants. Use `require()` for regular input checking.
