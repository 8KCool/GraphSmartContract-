The contract account state is changed after an external call.
Consider that the called contract could re-enter the function before this state change takes place. This can lead to business logic vulnerabilities.

The return value of a message call is not checked.
External calls return a boolean value. If the callee contract halts with an exception, 'false' is returned and execution continues in the caller. It is usually recommended to wrap external calls into a require statement to prevent unexpected states.
